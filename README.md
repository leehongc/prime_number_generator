# Prime Number Generator

The goal of this project is to create a script that continuously generates prime numbers and automatically saves them, in case of a crash.
Current requirement ideas of this project:
- Continuously backs up both prime and composite numbers
- Create different LED lighting effects to signal when a prime is found (for Raspberry Pi)
